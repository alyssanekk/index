The Promise: Blumenstock thinks that using phone data analaysis, governments could potentially provide humanitarian aid through easier mechanisms. He aims to start using general phone data to study who gets effected the most from natural health disasters, how people respond to crises, etc. The general study of human response to crisis, how they relocate, and other human behaviors can be studied so that eventually, phone data can help track and understand effects of natural disasters and other things on human populations and likely scenarios beyond that.
The Pitfalls: Blumenstock is very self-critical and he can see that phone data collection can be hard to regulate, have biased algorithms, have unanticipated effects, and has little validation because this study would be hard to test (there hasn't been much generalizing yer since people act differently in different situations based on a litany external and internal factors).
Looking Forward: For the future, Blumenstock wants to continue to use different data sets and build off of current research in order to have stronger validation for his promise and the potential use for it. In order for that to happen, he needs a greater sample size of mobile phones used by a variety of people so that he can later customize a certain "impact score"

Other: Professor Roessler is currently doing a research project on the impact of mobile phones in Tanzania on poverty. He's looking into how mobile phones can potentially help you with your lifestyle and income.


How do you respond to these ideas regarding "good intent," "transparency," and the difficult "balancing act" when considering the intersection of human development with data science?
-think about facebook and the corruption pitfalls
-accurate models for the spread of pandemics
