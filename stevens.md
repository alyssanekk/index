Question 1: In the readings for Tuesday and today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The authors use a "Random Forest" estimation technique to disaggregate census data. This technique uses a semi-automated dasymemtric  modeling approach that takes the data (both from the census and ancillary data) in a flexible manner. The flexibility piece likely refers to the maneuverability of the data/how easy it is to manipulate to get density results.

The Random Forest model takes log distribution data of population densities to create regression trees. The regression trees represent information from random selection predictors. It's a type of machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble method.

Question 2: The random forest method used bt the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to descriving and analyzing phenomenon and events?

A machine learning algorithms are

Question 3: In the readings, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were thesegeospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for interring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?
