#### Question 1: In the readings for Tuesday and today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The authors use a "Random Forest" estimation technique to disaggregate census data. This technique uses a semi-automated dasymemtric  modeling approach that takes the data (both from the census and ancillary data) in a flexible manner. The flexibility piece likely refers to the maneuverability of the data/how easy it is to manipulate to get density results. The Random Forest model takes log distribution data of population densities to create regression trees. The regression trees represent information from random selection predictors. It's a type of machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble method.

#### Question 2: The random forest method used bt the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to descriving and analyzing phenomenon and events?

A machine learning algorithms are

#### Question 3: In the readings, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were thesegeospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for interring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

#### Question 4: The author's results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of haveing a highly accurate description of where each person in located across the planet?

The results were the more accurate and less biased than other models. This gives countries the information they need in order to implement policy in the best way possible. The RF methods make distances to human resources more accurate. For example, you can look at distances to heatlh facilities/schools/roads easily. The variability of population density is clearly outlined and more accurate than other methods. This helps administrations with representations and how the land features can help people around them (resources, access, transportation, etc.)

#### Question 5: Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet Earth?

For Costa Rica, it might be easier for them to calculate what they need to do in order to meet their goals about carbon neutrality. Costa Rica wants to become carbon neutral by 2021, and looking at household data might help the administration and environmental groups locate where geothermal energy locations should be built. Additionally, it could help look at what the fastest energy transportation could go. The population dense areas should have easy access to energy, and less dense areas should also have access to energy and public resources as well. Census data for the UN is also important for looking at reproduction rates and population sizes in order to delegate financial support and other means of aid in a productive manner. This data will also help the country provide better healthcare access. If the distribution of healthcare centers are uneven, the human population distribution data will help decide where future development needs to occur.
