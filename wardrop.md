QUESTION: In the reading for today, the authors introduce a top-down method as well as a bottom-up method. Describe the two methods. 
Compare and contrast, What advantages do these new methodologies present when compared to past approaches?


The Wardrop et al article looks at spatially disaggregated population estimates. They argue that more accurate population data is key for the government, NGOs, and companies. The benefits include voting statistics, accurate service delivery, improved disease containment/monitoring, and proper disaster relief.

The top-down approach they use looks at proportional allocations of populations. In general, they take data from an arbitrary area set (following administrative boundaries or districts) to collect data.

The formula is:
census population counts + geospatial covariates CREATING population disaggregation CAUSING gridded populations
**the population disaggregation is a spatial weighting layer that uses dasymetric mapping

Examples: Products of top-down approaches include population grid counts that can show land distances to major roads. The data can also show strong, detailed imagery.

The bottom-up approach is:

microcensus population counts + geospatial coraviates CREATING population estimation models CREATING gridded population charts
**the population estimation is a prediction in unsurveyed areas that uses statistical modelling
