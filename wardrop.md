QUESTION: In the reading for today, the authors introduce a top-down method as well as a bottom-up method. Describe the two methods. 
Compare and contrast, What advantages do these new methodologies present when compared to past approaches?

The Wardrop et al article looks at spatially disaggregated population estimates. They argue that more accurate population data is key for the government, NGOs, and companies. The benefits include voting statistics, accurate service delivery, improved disease containment/monitoring, and proper disaster relief.

The top-down approach they use looks at proportional allocations of populations. In general, they take data from an arbitrary area set (following administrative boundaries or districts) to collect data. Dasymetric mapping techniques are used to isolate a covariate (variable, specific predictor) to get population distributions. It's very hard to use this approach for areas that don't have accurate census data. The map in the article was very telling about the difficulty to collect raw population data.

top-down approach formula:
census population counts + geospatial covariates CREATING population disaggregation CAUSING gridded populations
**the population disaggregation is a spatial weighting layer that uses dasymetric mapping

Examples: Products of top-down approaches include population grid counts that can show land distances to major roads. The data can also show strong, detailed imagery.

The bottom-up approach has become increasingly popular in areas with limited census data. It creates a similar gridded population result, but it uses specific mini data sets from surveys to generalize larger areas. It's more of an estimate and has a large range of error, but the statistical data sets are cheaper to collect and the information is easier to get in general.

bottom-up approach formula:

microcensus population counts + geospatial coraviates CREATING population estimation models CREATING gridded population charts
**the population estimation is a prediction in unsurveyed areas that uses statistical modelling

Examples: Mini survey data from urban areas can be used to estimate population sizing to then estimate the overall urban population.
