Random Forests

Question: In Nieves et al,  uses the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally? Describe in detail how random forest works.

The random forest machine learning method refers to the non linear statistical regression methods. It's a type of ensemble method that combines "decision trees" so that theres a stronger data area. This makes it easier to generalize data sets. Random forest also uses dasymetric mapping methods to estimate population layers from the census and covariate data. RF takes the layered data and aggregates them together to then try to figure out population distributions. The model then does this on its own and creates a best fit model depending on the location. 

Question: What is daysmmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans live?

Daysymmetric population allocation redistributes the population counts from census-based administrative units and puts them into grid cells based on the weighted layers (population densities here). Relationships between climate, topopgraphy, and transport links are extremely important when looking at population growth. It's easier to understand why growth occurred. Land cover and buildings are also important for predictions especially in urban areas. Envrionmental features can explain the bulk of why there are higher population densities(ecology and topography of low and middle income areas).

1. urban/suburban extents
2. built environment and urban/suburban proxies 
3. climatic/environmental variables 
4. populated place covariates
5. transportation networks
