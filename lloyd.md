NOTES:
scale = size of the projectm wants to figure out a way to zoom in on maps (ex: 100m, 30r)
disaggregation = taking pieces of a data set (infers that it's a big sample/population, large scale)
administrative area = a specific area, to look at geoboundaries, country borders, HDX and GADM
rasters/grid cells = the resolution, produced using satellite imagery from space
uniform distribution = equal distribution, each is evenly spaced apart
proportionate allocation = (dasymetric)

Question: In the Lloyd article, the authors instroduce a method that uses a number of different openly available geospatial datasets 
in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations. Describe the geospatial datasets the authors 
are using in their methodology. 

Geospatial Data Sets:
Standardise Viewfinder Panoramas = to see at 100m resolution
Geographical Information System (GIS) = 



How is their method an improvement when compared to a conventional census?





Are you able to describe how the authors use a number of different geospatial layers with their data science method in order to 
produce a high resolution, global gridded description of human population?
